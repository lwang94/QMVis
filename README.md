# QMVis

## Description:
A set of libraries meant to aid researchers and educators in visualizing principles of quantum mechanics. 
Can be used for creating interactive presentations and animated graphs to help illustrate quantum mechanical principles 
for people unfamiliar with the field. Currently can handle time independent wavefunctions for both bound and unbound potentials.

## TO DO:
- [ ] Incorporate time dependent behaviour
- [ ] Create visualizations for Dirac notation
- [ ] Incorporate multi-dimensional behaviour --> visualize hydrogen atom wavefunctions
- [ ] Incorporate more complex approximations such as the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation and the Nearly Free Electron
